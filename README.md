# Second-Hand Car Data Analysis

## Project Overview

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset of second-hand cars from a seller company. The objective is to uncover insights and patterns in the data that can inform business decisions and strategies.

## Dataset

The dataset includes the following columns:

- `Price`: Price of the car
- `Age`: Age of the car in years
- `KM`: Kilometers driven
- `FuelType`: Type of fuel used (Petrol, Diesel, CNG)
- `HP`: Horsepower
- `MetColor`: Whether the car has metallic color (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
- `Automatic`: Whether the car is automatic (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
- `CC`: Engine capacity in cubic centimeters
- `Doors`: Number of doors
- `Weight`: Weight of the car in kilograms

## Analysis Steps

1. **Data Understanding and Cleaning**
   - Load the dataset
   - Check for missing values and handle them
   - Verify and convert data types if necessary
   - Detect and handle outliers

2. **Univariate Analysis**
   - Analyze the distribution of individual features using histograms and box plots

3. **Bivariate Analysis**
   - Explore relationships between pairs of variables using scatter plots and box plots

4. **Multivariate Analysis**
   - Examine interactions between multiple variables using correlation matrix and pair plots

5. **Feature Engineering**
   - Create new features to gain additional insights

6. **Statistical Analysis**
   - Perform hypothesis testing for categorical features

7. **Data Visualization**
   - Use advanced visualizations to uncover deeper insights

8. **Summary of Findings**
   - Summarize key insights and patterns discovered during the analysis

9. **Business Recommendations**
   - Provide actionable recommendations based on the analysis

## Key Findings

- Older cars and cars with higher mileage tend to be priced lower.
- Diesel and automatic cars generally have higher prices.
- Higher horsepower is associated with higher prices.

## Business Recommendations

1. Use insights from the analysis to set competitive prices.
2. Focus on acquiring cars with features that fetch higher prices.
3. Highlight popular features in marketing materials.
4. Offer extended warranties for older cars.
5. Tailor marketing efforts based on customer preferences.
