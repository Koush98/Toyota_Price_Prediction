# Toyota Second-Hand Car Price Prediction

## Project Overview
This project involves developing a machine learning model to predict the prices of second-hand Toyota cars. The primary objective is to help potential buyers and sellers estimate the fair market value of used Toyota vehicles based on various features.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information about various second-hand Toyota cars, including features such as year, model, mileage, fuel type, and more.

## Installation
To run this project locally, you need to have Python installed. Follow the steps below to set up the environment:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
    cd your-repository
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The EDA phase involved:
- Understanding the distribution of each feature.
- Identifying correlations between features and the target variable (price).
- Handling missing values and outliers.

Key insights from the EDA are presented in the accompanying Jupyter notebooks.

## Modeling
The modeling phase included:
- Data preprocessing (e.g., encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features).
- Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
- Training multiple models, including:
  - Linear Regression
  - Polynomial Regression
  - Decision Tree Regressor
  - Random Forest Regressor
- Evaluating model performance using metrics such as RMSE and R^2.

## Results
The Polynomial Regression model provided the best results with the following metrics:
- RMSE: [Your RMSE value]
- R^2: [Your R^2 value]

Visualizations of the predicted vs. actual prices are available in the results section of the notebook.

## Conclusion
The project successfully developed a model to predict second-hand Toyota car prices with reasonable accuracy. Polynomial Regression proved to be the most effective model for this dataset.

## Future Work
Future improvements to this project could include:
- Incorporating additional features to improve prediction accuracy.
- Using advanced techniques like ensemble learning.
- Deploying the model as a web application for real-time price predictions.
